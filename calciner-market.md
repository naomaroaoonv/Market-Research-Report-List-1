<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Calciner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Directly Heated Calciners</li><li>Indirectly Heated Calciners</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The calciner market comprises primarily two types: directly heated and indirectly heated calciners. Directly heated calciners utilize fuel to heat the material directly, offering rapid processing and efficient heat transfer, suitable for high-temperature applications. Conversely, indirectly heated calciners transfer heat through radiant or conductive means, ensuring that the process material does not come into contact with combustion gases, which is ideal for sensitive materials that require contamination-free processing. Each type serves specific industrial needs based on temperature control and material integrity.</p></p>
