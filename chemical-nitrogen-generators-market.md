<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chemical Nitrogen Generators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure Swing Adsorption</li><li>Membrane</li><li>Cryogenic Air</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The chemical nitrogen generators market comprises three primary types: Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA), Membrane, and Cryogenic Air. PSA utilizes a process of adsorption and desorption under varying pressure to separate nitrogen from oxygen and other gases, producing high-purity nitrogen. Membrane technology employs selective permeation through polymer membranes to achieve nitrogen separation, offering a compact solution for lower purity needs. Cryogenic air separation involves cooling air to liquefy it, separating nitrogen from oxygen based on different boiling points for high-volume applications.</p></p>
