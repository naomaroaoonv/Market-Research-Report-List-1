<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Defibrillators for Public Access Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automated</li><li>Fully automated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Defibrillators for public access are classified mainly into two types: semi-automated and fully automated. Semi-automated defibrillators require user intervention after device analysis, prompting the operator to press a button to deliver a shock if necessary. In contrast, fully automated defibrillators analyze heart rhythm and automatically administer a shock without requiring any action from the user. This differentiation caters to varying levels of responder training and confidence, enhancing public safety by making defibrillation more accessible in emergency situations.</p></p>
