<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plethysmometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soaked Plethysmometer</li><li>Non-soaked Plethysmometer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The plethysmometer market can be divided into two main types: soaked and non-soaked plethysmometers. Soaked plethysmometers are designed to measure volume changes in submerged objects or materials, offering precise results in fluid environments. Non-soaked plethysmometers, on the other hand, measure volume changes without the need for a liquid medium, making them suitable for a wider range of applications, particularly in solid or air-filled environments. Both types serve critical roles in fields like healthcare, research, and industrial applications.</p></p>
